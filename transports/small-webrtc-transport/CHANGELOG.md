# Changelog

All notable changes to **Pipecat Small WebRTC Transport** will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

- Deprecated the `webrtcUrl` field, replacing it with a new `webrtcRequestParams` field, adding support for passing a complete `APIRequest` type to define the connection endpoint. This allows clients to pass custom headers and data along to the offer/answer endpoint at connection time.

## [1.3.0]

### Added

- Added support for screensharing.

### Changed

- Bump daily-js version dependency to 0.83.1 to get Chrome 140 fix

## [1.2.0]

- Deprecated the transport option `connectionUrl` in lieu of a new and hopefully less confusingly named `webrtcUrl` field

## [1.1.0]

- Add support for generating `onDeviceError` callbacks/events when receiving a camera or speaker error.

## [1.0.0]

- PipecatClient and Transport 1.0.0 Updates:
  See [the migration guide](https://docs.pipecat.ai/client/js/migration-guide) for details
  - Updated SmallWebRTCTransport to PipecatClient 1.0.0 changes, which include:
    - Updating naming/dependencies from RTVIClient -> PipecatClient
    - Modified connect() to follow the new pattern of providing connection details at the time of connection vs. constructor
    - Added validation for connection parameters

## [0.4.0]

- Bumped dependency to @pipecat-ai/client-js@~0.4.0

## [0.0.5] - 2025-05-19

### Fixed

- `SmallWebRTCTransport` updates transport state to 'ready' when client ready message is sent.

## [0.0.4] - 2025-04-29

### Added

- Added `waitForICEGathering` property: this allows users to configure whether the transport should 
    explicitly wait for the iceGatheringState to become complete during the negotiation phase.

### Fixed

- `SmallWebRTCTransport` class now accepts `RTCIceServer`[] instead of just the `String`[] of urls.

### Added

- Handling a new incoming `peerLeft` signalling messages from Pipecat.
