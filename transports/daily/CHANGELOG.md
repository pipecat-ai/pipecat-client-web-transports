  - Updated DailyTransport to PipecatClient 1.0.0 changes, which include:

    - Added AudioBufferingStarted/Stopped events to allowable base callbacks, making registering for these events simpler and done in the same way you register for other RTVI events.

- Fix issue resulting in the camera starting despite enableCam setting.

## [0.3.7]

- Added support for disconnecting the client if the Daily call errors out.

## [0.3.6]

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where the transport could call `clientReady()` multiple times,
  once for each `track-started` event. Now, `clientReady()` is called for the
  first track only.

- Added support for buffering audio until the bot is ready using the
  `bufferLocalAudioUntilBotReady` property. Once the bot is ready, the buffered
  audio will be sent, allowing the user to begin speaking before the bot has
  joined the call.
